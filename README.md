# Simple ETL Project

This project is a basic implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. It demonstrates how to extract data from a source, transform it to meet specific requirements, and load it into a target destination.

## Features

- **Extract**: Retrieve data from various sources (e.g., CSV, JSON, APIs).
- **Transform**: Clean, filter, and manipulate data to fit the desired format.
- **Load**: Store the processed data into a database or file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your_username/simple_etl.git
  cd simple_etl
  ```

2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Usage

1. Configure the ETL pipeline by editing the `config.yaml` file.
2. Run the ETL script:
  ```bash
  python etl.py
  ```
